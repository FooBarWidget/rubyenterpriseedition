// If you change this function, also change GetStackTrace above:
//
// This GetStackFrames routine shares a lot of code with GetStackTrace
// above. This code could have been refactored into a common routine,
// and then both GetStackTrace/GetStackFrames could call that routine.
// There are two problems with that:
//
// (1) The performance of the refactored-code suffers substantially - the
//     refactored needs to be able to record the stack trace when called
//     from GetStackTrace, and both the stack trace and stack frame sizes,
//     when called from GetStackFrames - this introduces enough new
//     conditionals that GetStackTrace performance can degrade by as much
//     as 50%.
//
// (2) Whether the refactored routine gets inlined into GetStackTrace and
//     GetStackFrames depends on the compiler, and we can't guarantee the
//     behavior either-way, even with "__attribute__ ((always_inline))"
//     or "__attribute__ ((noinline))". But we need this guarantee or the
//     frame counts may be off by one.
//
// Both (1) and (2) can be addressed without this code duplication, by
// clever use of template functions, and by defining GetStackTrace and
// GetStackFrames as macros that expand to these template functions.
// However, this approach comes with its own set of problems - namely,
// macros and  preprocessor trouble - for example,  if GetStackTrace
// and/or GetStackFrames is ever defined as a member functions in some
// class, we are in trouble.
