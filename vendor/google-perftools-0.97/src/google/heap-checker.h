// Module for detecing heap (memory) leaks.
//
// For full(er) information, see doc/heap_checker.html
//
// This module can be linked into programs with
// no slowdown caused by this unless you activate the leak-checker:
//
//    1. Set the environment variable HEAPCHEK to _type_ before
//       running the program.
//
// _type_ is usually "normal" but can also be "minimal", "strict", or
// "draconian".  (See the html file for other options, like 'local'.)
//
// After that, just run your binary.  If the heap-checker detects
// a memory leak at program-exit, it will print instructions on how
// to track down the leak.

  // Static helpers to make us ignore certain leaks.

  // NOTE: All calls to DisableChecks* affect all later heap profile generation
  // that happens in our construction and inside of *NoLeaks().

  // CAVEAT: Disabling via all the DisableChecks* functions happens only
  // up to kMaxStackTrace stack frames (see heap-profile-table.h)
  // down from the stack frame identified by the function.
  // Hence, this disabling will stop working for very deep call stacks
  // and you might see quite wierd leak profile dumps in such cases.

  // CAVEAT: Disabling via DisableChecksIn works only with non-strip'ped
  // binaries.  It's better not to use this function if at all possible.
  //
  // Register 'pattern' as another variant of a regular expression to match
  // function_name, file_name:line_number, or function_address
  // of function call/return points for which allocations below them should be
  // ignored during heap leak checking.

  //    <do things>
  //    HeapLeakChecker::DisableChecksToHereFrom(start_address);
  //    ...
  // will disable heap leak checking for everything that happens
  // during any execution of <do things> (including any calls from it),
  // i.e. all objects allocated from there
  // and everything reachable from them will not be considered a leak.
  // Each such pair of function calls must be from the same function,
  // because this disabling works by remembering the range of
  // return program counter addresses for the two calls.

  // ADVICE: Use GetDisableChecksStart, DisableChecksToHereFrom
  //         instead of DisableChecksUp|At whenever possible
  //         to make the code less fragile under different degrees of inlining.
  // Register the function call point (return program counter address)
  // 'stack_frames' above us for which allocations
  // (everything reachable from them) below it should be
  // ignored during heap leak checking.
  // 'stack_frames' must be >= 1 (in most cases one would use the value of 1).
  // For example
  //    void Foo() {  // Foo() should not get inlined
  //      HeapLeakChecker::DisableChecksUp(1);
  //      <do things>
  //    }
  // will disable heap leak checking for everything that happens
  // during any execution of <do things> (including any calls from it),
  // i.e. all objects allocated from there
  // and everything reachable from them will not be considered a leak.
  // CAVEAT: If Foo() is inlined this will disable heap leak checking
  // under all processing of all functions Foo() is inlined into.
  // Hence, for potentially inlined functions, use the GetDisableChecksStart,
  // DisableChecksToHereFrom calls instead.
  // (In the above example we store and use the return program counter
  //  addresses from Foo to do the disabling.)

  //      <do things>
  //    }
  //    void Bar() {
  //      Foo();
  //      CHECK(!HeapLeakChecker::HaveDisabledChecksUp(1));
  //        // This will fail if Foo() got inlined into Bar()
  //        // (due to more aggressive optimization in the (new) compiler)
  //        // which breaks the intended behavior of DisableChecksUp(1) in it.
