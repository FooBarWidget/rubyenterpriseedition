=== Compatibility issues (excluding feature bug fixes)

* builtin classes

  * Time#to_s now returns a string in a form that
    conforms to RFC2822.

      # Before
      "Wed Mar 03 12:34:56 JST 2007"
      # After
      "Wed, Mar 03 2007 12:34:56 +0900"

  * String#intern now raises SecurityError when $SAFE level is greater
    than zero.

* fileutils

  * A minor implementation change breaks Rake <=0.7.1.
    Updating Rake to 0.7.2 fixes the problem.

* digest

  * The constructor does no longer take an initial
    string to feed; digest() and hexdigest() now do,
    instead.  The following examples show how to
    migrate:

      # Before
      md = Digest::MD5.new("string")
      # After (works with any version)
      md = Digest::MD5.new.update("string")
        
      # Before
      hd = Digest::MD5.new("string").hexdigest
      # After (works with any version)
      hd = Digest::MD5.hexdigest("string")
