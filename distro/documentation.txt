= Ruby Enterprise Edition Features Guide

== Overview of Ruby Enterprise Edition
Ruby Enterprise Edition (REE) is a server-oriented distribution of the official Ruby interpreter, and includes various additional enhancements:

- A copy-on-write friendly garbage collector. Phusion Passenger uses this, in combination with a technique called preforking, to reduce Ruby on Rails applications' memory usage by 33% on average.
- An improved memory allocator called tcmalloc, which improves performance quite a bit.
- The ability to tweak garbage collector settings for maximum server performance.
- The ability to inspect the garbage collector's state and the object heap state, for debugging purposes.
- The ability to obtain backtraces for all running threads, making it easier for one to debug multithreaded applications.

Some of these features are gathered from third party Ruby patches:
RailsBench, RubyProf, caller_for_all_threads.


=== Installation via Debian package or source tarball
To install REE, download either the source tarball or the Debian package
from the REE website. The source tarball contains a cross-platform installer.
Installation instructions are available on the download page.

Note that this installer is written in Ruby, and thus requires a Ruby
interpreter to run. Because not all systems come with a Ruby interpreter by
default, the source tarball also contains a number of precompiled Ruby
interpreters for various platforms, with the purpose of running the installer.
The `installer` script will automatically use a precompiled Ruby binary for the
current platform, if available. Precompiled Ruby interpreters for the following
platforms are included:

- x86 Linux
- x86_64 Linux
- x86 FreeBSD 6
- Solaris

MacOS X and most FreeBSD systems already come with a Ruby interpreter by default.

So if you notice that the installer fails to start, please install Ruby first,
then re-run the installer.

WARNING: It is not recommended to install REE into '/usr' because it can
overwrite your existing Ruby installation in a way that the system doesn't
expect. You should install REE into an isolated place such as '/opt'.

==== Installation options

===== Disabling tcmalloc
If you experience problems with the tcmalloc memory allocator, then you can
install REE without tcmalloc by passing `--no-tcmalloc` to the installer.

===== Non-interactive installation
You can installer REE non-interactively either by using the Debian package,
or by passing `--auto=DIRECTORY` to the REE installer. The latter will
instruct the installer to non-interactively install REE into the specified
target directory.

=== Manual installation (for experts)
If you wish to install REE from source, but do not wish to use the included
installer, or if the installer doesn't work, then you can install REE manually.
Please follow the instructions below.

Note that these instructions do not cover installing RubyGems.

==== Prerequisites

You need to have the following dependencies installed:

1. A C and C++ compiler, preferrably gcc.
2. C development headers for zlib.
3. C development headers for OpenSSL.
4. C development headers for GNU Readline.
5. yacc or bison.

==== Step 1: Download and extract the source tarball
Type:
--------------------------
tar xzvf ruby-enterprise-x.x.x.tar.gz
--------------------------

A directory called 'ruby-enterprise-x.x.x' will now appear.

==== Step 2: Install tcmalloc
Tcmalloc is a memory allocator which is usually more efficient than the
platform's native memory allocator. REE doesn't require tcmalloc, but it will
work better if tcmalloc is installed.

Compile tcmalloc as follows:

--------------------------
cd ruby-enterprise-x.x.x/source/vendor/google-perftools-*
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX --disable-dependency-tracking
make libtcmalloc_minimal.la
--------------------------

where '$PREFIX' is the prefix you want to install tcmalloc to. If compilation
fails, then skip to step 3. REE will work fine without tcmalloc.

After compilation, install tcmalloc as follows:

--------------------------
sudo mkdir -p $PREFIX/lib
sudo rm -f $PREFIX/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal*.so*
sudo cp -pf .libs/libtcmalloc_minimal*.so* $PREFIX/lib/
--------------------------

.MacOS X note
NOTE: Instead of typing 'libtcmalloc_minimal*.so*', type
      'libtcmalloc_minimal*.bundle*'.

NOTE: The reason why we don't instruct you to type 'make' and 'make install'
      is because compiling tcmalloc with 'make' usually doesn't work on 64-bit
      platforms. The above instructions are a little bit more complex, but they
      work on all platforms where tcmalloc is supported.

==== Step 3: Configure REE

Change the current working directory to 'ruby-enterprise-x.x.x/source'. If
you were previously in the google-perftools directory, then type:

--------------------------
cd ../..
--------------------------

Run the configure script:

--------------------------
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
--------------------------

where '$PREFIX' is the prefix you want to install tcmalloc to.

==== Step 4: Compiling and installing the system_allocator library (MacOS X only)

If you are on MacOS X, then compile and install the 'sytem_allocator' library:

--------------------------
gcc -dynamiclib system_allocator.c -install_name @rpath/libsystem_allocator.dylib -o libsystem_allocator.dylib
sudo install source/libsystem_allocator.dylib $PREFIX/lib/
--------------------------

==== Step 5: compiling and installing REE

Open 'Makefile'. Search for a line which starts with:

--------------------------
LIBS = 
--------------------------

Append the string '$(PRELIBS)' to the part after the '=' sign. For example,
on Ubuntu 8.04, the 'LIBS = ' line becomes:

--------------------------
LIBS = $(PRELIBS) -ldl -lcrypt -lm  $(EXTLIBS)
--------------------------

Save the file. Now we can proceed with compiling REE:

--------------------------
make PRELIBS="-Wl,-rpath,$PREFIX/lib -L$PREFIX/lib -ltcmalloc_minimal"
--------------------------

Notes:

1. If you did not install tcmalloc, then you can omit the '-ltcmalloc_minimal'
   part.
2. If you are on MacOS X, then you need to append '-lsystem_allocator' to the
   'PRELIBS' option.

Now that REE has been compiled, install it with:

--------------------------
sudo make install
--------------------------


=== How REE installs itself into the system
By default, REE installs itself into a directory in '/opt'. If you already had a
Ruby interpreter installed (typically in '/usr'; let's call this 'the system Ruby
interpreter'), then REE will have no effect on it: REE lives in isolation and in
parallel to the system Ruby interpreter. This also means that:

- If you have any software which depends on the system Ruby interpreter, then
  that software will not break. It will continue to work like before.
- REE has its own set of Ruby libraries, and its own set of gems and its own
  set of commands. If you install a new gem using the system Ruby interpreter,
  then that gem will not show up in REE's gem list, and vice versa.
- When running Ruby programs, the system Ruby interpreter will be used unless
  you explicitly configures the system to use REE by default.

[NOTE]
.Why doesn't REE use the system Ruby interpreter's gems?
REE does not use the system Ruby interpreter's gems because it can cause
problems with native extensions, e.g. RMagick, Mongrel, Hpricot, etc. A native
extension compiled for one Ruby installation might crash when used in a
different Ruby installation. This is why you must reinstall your gems in
REE.

=== Using REE
Normally one would run a Ruby program by invoking the Ruby interpreter with a
source file as its first argument:

--------------------------
$ ruby some_program.rb
--------------------------

To run the same program in REE, invoke the equivalent command in REE's
'bin' folder:

--------------------------------------------------------
$ /opt/ruby-enterprise-X.X.X/bin/ruby some_program.rb
--------------------------------------------------------

The same applies to other Ruby commands such as 'gem', 'irb' and
'rake'. For example, if you want to install Ruby on Rails for REE, invoke:

--------------------------------------------------------
$ /opt/ruby-enterprise-X.X.X/bin/gem install rails
--------------------------------------------------------

=== Using REE with Phusion Passenger
To use REE in combination with Phusion Passenger, you must run the Passenger
Apache 2 module installer that's associated with REE. The REE installer installs
the Passenger gem by default, so you just have to run the Passenger Apache 2
module installer:

-------------------------------------------------
/opt/ruby-enterprise-X.X.X/bin/passenger-install-apache2-module
-------------------------------------------------

Then follow the instructions that the installer gives you.

=== Configuring REE as the default Ruby interpreter
It is possible to configure REE as the default Ruby interpreter, so that when
you type 'ruby', 'gem', 'irb', 'rake' or other Ruby commands, REE's version is
invoked instead of the system Ruby's version.

To do this, you must add REE's 'bin' directory to the beginning of the `PATH`
environment variable. This environment variable specifies the command shell's
command search path. For example, you can do this on the command-line:

-------------------------------------
$ ruby some_program.rb    # <--- some_program.rb is being run
                          #      in the system Ruby interpreter.

$ export PATH=/opt/ruby-enterprise-X.X.X/bin:$PATH
$ ruby some_program.rb    # <--- some_program.rb will now be run in REE!
-------------------------------------

Invoking `export PATH=...` on the command-line has no permanent effect: its
effects disappear as soon as you exit the shell. To make the effect permanent,
add an entry to the file `/etc/environment` instead. On Ubuntu Linux,
`/etc/environment` looks like this:

-------------------------------------
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LANGUAGE="en_US:en"
-------------------------------------

Add REE's 'bin' directory to the PATH environment variable, like this:

-------------------------------------
PATH="/opt/ruby-enterprise-x.x.x/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games"
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LANGUAGE="en_US:en"
-------------------------------------

=== Upgrading
To upgrade REE through the Debian package, just install the Debian package.

To upgrade REE through the source tarball, run the installer in the source
tarball and specify the same destination prefix directory that REE is currently
installed in. For example, if REE is currently installed in
'/opt/ruby-enterprise-20081215', then specify '/opt/ruby-enterprise-20081215'
in the upgrade source tarball's installer.

=== Uninstallation
If you installed REE through a Debian package, then uninstall the Debian package
with 'dpkg' or with 'apt-get'.

If you installed REE through the source tarball, then you can uninstall it by
deleting the directory in which REE is installed. For example, if REE was
installed to '/opt/ruby-enterprise-X.X.X' (the default), then just delete that
directory. It is for this reason why we recommend installing REE into its own
directory.

== Copy-on-write friendliness of the garbage collector
By default, REE's garbage collector is not copy-on-write-friendly, just like
a stock Ruby interpreter. Copy-on-write-friendliness can be turned on during
runtime by calling:

[source, ruby]
-----------------------------------------------
GC.copy_on_write_friendly = true
-----------------------------------------------

Note that Phusion Passenger automatically turns on the copy-on-write-friendly
mode whenever it detects that it's running in REE.

With the following method, one can check whether the garbage collector is in
copy-on-write-friendly mode:

[source, ruby]
-----------------------------------------------
GC.copy_on_write_friendly?
-----------------------------------------------


== Garbage collector performance tuning
Ruby's garbage collector tries to adapt memory usage to the amount of memory
used by the program by dynamically growing or shrinking the allocated heap as
it sees fit. For long running server applications, this approach isn't always
the most efficient one. The performance very much depends on the ratio
`heap_size / program_size`. It behaves somewhat erratic: adding code can
actually make your program run faster.

With REE, one can tune the garbage collector's behavior for better server
performance. It is possible to specify the initial heap size to start with.
The heap size will never drop below the initial size. By carefully selecting
the initial heap size one can decrease startup time and increase throughput
of server applications.

Garbage collector behavior is controlled through the following environment
variables. These environment variables must be set prior to invoking the Ruby
interpreter.

*`RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS`*::
	This specifies the initial number of heap slots. The default is '10000'.

*`RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_INCREMENT`*::
	The number of additional heap slots to allocate when Ruby needs to
	allocate new heap slots for the first time. The default is '10000'.
+
For example, suppose that the default GC settings are in effect, and 10000 Ruby
objects exist on the heap (= 10000 used heap slots). When the program creates
another object, Ruby will allocate a new heap with 10000 heap slots in it.
There are now 20000 heap slots in total, of which 10001 are used and 9999 are
unused.

*`RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_GROWTH_FACTOR`*::
	Multiplicator used for calculating the number of new heaps slots to
	allocate next time Ruby needs new heap slots. The default is '1.8'.
+
Take the program in the last example. Suppose that the program creates 10000
more objects. Upon creating the 10000th object, Ruby needs to allocate another
heap. This heap will have `10000 * 1.8 = 18000` heap slots. There are now
`20000 + 18000 = 38000` heap slots in total, of which 20001 are used and
17999 are unused.
+
The next time Ruby needs to allocate a new heap, that heap will have
`18000 * 1.8 = 32400` heap slots.

*`RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT`*::
	The amount of C data structures which can be allocated without
	triggering a garbage collection. If this is set too low, then the
	garbage collector will be started even if there are empty heap slots
	available. The default value is '8000000'.

*`RUBY_HEAP_FREE_MIN`*::
	The number of heap slots that should be available after a garbage
	collector run. If fewer heap slots are available, then Ruby will
	allocate a new heap according to the `RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_INCREMENT` and
	`RUBY_HEAP_SLOTS_GROWTH_FACTOR` parameters. The default value is '4096'.

The best settings varies from application to application. You should try
experimenting with the values. 37signals uses the following settings in
production:

----------------------------------
RUBY_HEAP_MIN_SLOTS=600000
RUBY_GC_MALLOC_LIMIT=59000000
RUBY_HEAP_FREE_MIN=100000
----------------------------------

== Garbage collector statistics
One can inspect various garbage collector statistics by calling certain methods.
Statistics collection is disabled by default, so before one can obtain the
statistics, statistics collection must be enabled by calling:

[source,ruby]
--------------------------
GC.enable_stats
--------------------------

There's a very minor performance penalty when statistics collection is enabled.
Statistics collection can be disabled by calling:

[source,ruby]
--------------------------
GC.disable_stats
--------------------------

The following methods are available for obtaining the collected statistics
information:

*`GC.collections`*::
	Returns the number of garbage collections that have been performed
	since GC statistics collection was enabled.
+
[source, ruby]
----------------------------
GC.enable_stats
do_something
GC.collections     # => 20
----------------------------

*`GC.time`*::
	Returns the total amount of time that has been spent on garbage
	collection since GC statistics collection was enabled, in microseconds.
+
[source, ruby]
----------------------------
GC.enable_stats
do_something
GC.time            # => 3000000
----------------------------

*`GC.dump`*::
	Dumps information about the current GC data structures to the GC
	log file, to `stderr` if no GC log file is specified. One can specify
	the GC log file in the `RUBY_GC_DATA_FILE` environment variable, which
	must be set before starting the Ruby interpreter.
+
At this moment, the only thing that this method does is printing the size of
each Ruby heap.

The collected statistics information can be cleared by calling:

[source,ruby]
--------------------------
GC.clear_stats
--------------------------


== Memory allocation and object heap statistics
One can obtain various statistics about object allocation. Some of the
statistics methods listed here require one to explicitly enable statistics
collection, just like the garbage collection statistics methods.

The following methods are available:

*`GC.allocated_size`*::
	Returns the amount of memory (in bytes) that has been allocated since
	GC statistics collection was enabled. This is the total amount of bytes
	that has been passed to the C function `ruby_xmalloc()` so far.
+
[source, ruby]
--------------------------------
GC.allocated_size    #=> 4070
--------------------------------

*`GC.num_allocations`*::
	Returns the number of memory allocation requests that have been
	performed since GC statistics collection was enabled. This is the
	number of times that the C function `ruby_xmalloc()` has been called.
+
[source, ruby]
--------------------------------
GC.num_allocations   #=> 4070
--------------------------------

*`ObjectSpace.live_objects`*::
	Returns the number of objects that are currently allocated in the
	system. This value usually goes down after the garbage collector runs.
	This method does not require one to enable statistics collection.
+
[source, ruby]
--------------------------------
ObjectSpace.live_objects   #=> 30873
--------------------------------

*`ObjectSpace.allocated_objects`*::
	Returns the number of objects that have been allocated since the Ruby
	interpreter started. This number can only increase. To know how many
	objects are currently allocated, use `ObjectSpace.live_objects` instead.
+
[source, ruby]
--------------------------------
ObjectSpace.allocated_objects   #=> 33266
--------------------------------


== Obtaining the backtrace of all threads
The method `caller_for_all_threads` returns a Hash which maps each currently
running thread to the thread's backtrace. A backtrace is an array of strings,
in the same format as the return value of the method `caller`. For example,
consider the following program `test.rb`:

[source, ruby]
---------------------------------
require 'thread'
require 'pp'

def foo
   bar
end

def bar
   sleep 10
end

thread1 = Thread.new do
   foo
end

thread2 = Thread.new do
   STDIN.readline
end

# Give other threads some chance to run.
sleep 0.1

pp caller_for_all_threads
---------------------------------

This program will print:

---------------------------------
{#<Thread:0x8261954 sleep>=>
  ["test.rb:9:in `bar'",
   "test.rb:5:in `foo'",
   "test.rb:13",
   "test.rb:12:in `initialize'",
   "test.rb:12:in `new'",
   "test.rb:12"],
 #<Thread:0x81986a8 run>=>["test.rb:23"],
 #<Thread:0x82618c8 sleep>=>
  ["test.rb:17",
   "test.rb:16:in `initialize'",
   "test.rb:16:in `new'",
   "test.rb:16"]}
---------------------------------

=== Phusion Passenger integration
`caller_for_all_threads` support is integrated into Phusion Passenger version 2.1
(which at the time of writing hasn't been released yet). Upon sending a 'SIGQUIT'
signal to a Phusion Passenger backend process, it will print the backtrace of
all threads to the Apache error log. This feature is also documented in the
Phusion Passenger users guide.
